This project is a review of the article The Stochastic Behavior of Commodity Prices: Implications for Valuation and Hedging; EDUARDO S. SCHWARTZ; July 3, 1997

We present a complete summary of the article as well as few critics and developments in the file "Stochastic_behavior_commodity_spotPrices.pdf".

The study was conducted by Johan Macq in ENSAE Master 2 year.

In the Python notebook "Shock_simulation_oil_SpotPrice" you will find a quick implementation of the third model proposed by the author.
The model consists in a stochastic spot price, a stochastic mean-reverting convenience yield and an interest rate following an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as in Vasicek (1977).
We also implemented an exogenous shock on the spot price and the convenience yield and see its consequences on their evolutions, as well as on the 1-month future price.
